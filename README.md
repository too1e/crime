In this analysis I was aiming to replicate the results of 'Income inequality and crime in the United States', by Jongmook Choe (2008).  Choe's paper explores the relationship between income inequality and crime rates. Specifically, it aims to investigate whether variations in income inequality, measured by the Gini ratio, are associated with changes in crime rates across different US states from 1995 to 2004. These effects are broken down by type of crime, so we can examine separately the effects of income inequality for different types of crime. I theorized that income inequality would have a greater impact on non-violent crimes such as burglary, and less of an impact on crimes such as murder. 

I do think there is an intrinsic understanding that can be derived for why greater income inequality may lead to higher crime rates, especially within non-violent property crimes. Imagine growing up in a city like San Francisco. You watch your city become more and more expensive, as your family struggles to keep up with rising rent prices. Meanwhile, a growing population of high-income tech workers moves into your neighborhood, driving flashy cars and dining at restaurants you can’t afford. This stark contrast isn’t just a backdrop; it becomes a constant reminder of the divide between what you have and what seems just out of reach. The envy that festers in such an environment isn’t merely about wanting what others have— it’s about the frustration of feeling excluded from the opportunities that others take for granted. This emotional response can act as a catalyst, pushing individuals toward crime as a misguided attempt to bridge the gap or reclaim a sense of control over their circumstances. It’s not just about poverty; it’s about the perceived fairness— or lack thereof— in the distribution of wealth and opportunities within one’s immediate environment. 

One paper that is very similar to Professor Choe’s is 'Inequality and Crime', by Morgan Kelly (2002). This paper examines the same relationship between crime rates and inequality, also opting to use the Gini-coefficient as the variable of inequality. The study runs similar regressions aimed at identifying the relationship between these variables while controlling for a variety of other, potentially confounding variables. Choe improved this regression by separating crime rate by type of crime, as the previous paper only had a binary distinction between violent and non-violent crimes. This newer approach allows us to see with greater clarity the relationship between income inequality and specific types of crime, providing more specific and actionable insights. A more recent paper The Crime Rate of five Latin American Countries: Does Income Inequality Matter? examines the same relationship of crime and inequality across several Latin American countries. I believe this paper improved upon the previous studies, as the researchers noted the relationship between these variables was likely asymmetrical, as humans tend to recover differently from negative stimuli rather than from positive stimuli. This assumption led to them examining separately the effects of rising income inequality and lowering income inequality on crime rates. This distinction allowed for a more accurate and comprehensive model for the relationship between crime and income inequality. 

The main strength of the paper is its separation of crime rates into rates of specific categories of crime. Using these categories provides a more nuanced understanding of the impact of income inequality on crime, and models a more accurate relationship than previous studies that did not separate crime rates by type. Moreover, the use of panel data covering many states and territories over a ten-year period adds robustness to the analysis and enhances the intuition of the results. I believe one weakness of this paper is its reliance on the Gini ratio as the sole measure of income inequality. While the Gini ratio is a widely used metric, it may not capture the full complexity of income distribution and inequality across the United States. I also believe important variables may have been omitted, and that controlling for a wider range of variables may help improve the accuracy of the model. Specifically, I would include a variable on a state’s minimum wage, as minimum wage has also been observed to have a highly correlated relationship with crime rates. 

My motivation for researching this topic arose when I watched a documentary on the rise of crime in San Francisco, which included interviews with many individuals that openly commited property theft as a means of income. These individuals shared their methods of crime and motivations for doing so, with many of them claiming that it is truly a necessity for them to survive. Hearing these personal stories underscored the complex reality that crime often stems from systemic issues rather than simple moral failings. It’s a stark reminder that addressing the root causes of crime— such as income inequality, lack of affordable housing, and limited access to opportunities— is crucial in creating safer communities. By better understanding the broader socio-economic factors at play, we can begin to shift the narrative from one of blame to one of empathy and actionable solutions, ultimately aiming for a society where survival doesn't have to come at the cost of others.
